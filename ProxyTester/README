 ProxyTester is a python script which helps you to check the validity of
 on-line and off-line proxy lists.

 The script performs the following checks:
  1. Connection - downloads a JSON file from gnuton.org
  2. Latency - mesures time spent to get a JSON file
  3. Anonimity - performed by the PHP script on gnuton.org

 If the script is launched in "network" mode with the command ./proxytester network,
 it gets a proxy list from the net and checks every proxy there. 
 At the end it waits for 120 seconds before re-starting the process over.

 The PHP script which helps ProxyChecker to test the proxy type is in this repos and 
 it can be tested at the following address http://www.gnuton.org/proxychecker/index.php
 If you have any hint about how to increase the proxy anonymity analysis, 
 drop me a tweet or mail!
