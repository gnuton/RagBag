# Javascript #

## Inheritance & objects ##

### Objects inheritance  ###
Every javascript object derives from Object
````
> Object
> function Object() { [native code] }
````

Now we define two objects and we make one inherith the other one.

````
// Create base obj: Object {name: "no name", age: 0}
var person = {name: "no name", age: 0}

// Create a new obj: Object {name: "antonio"}
var antonio = {name: "antonio"}

// Set person base object for "antonio"
// Antonio will look like: Object {name: "no name", age: 0}
// it will inherit other fields defined in the base class
antonio.__proto__ = person

// if we add a new field to person it will be added to the inherited classes too
person.newfield = true;
// antonio now looks like this: Object {name: "antonio", age: 0, newfield: true}


// Deleting a field from antonio will reset the value to the one defined in the base object
// antonio.name == "antonio" at beginning. Let's delete it!
delete antonio.name;
// now antonio looks like this Object {name: "no name", age: 0, newfield: true}
// where name="no name" which is the default value set in the base object for the "name" field.

````

### Classes inheritance  ###
Well... there are no classes in Javascript. As we have already seen in the previous chapter in Javascript we have "PROTOTYPES".
Methods live in prototypes:
````
// Let's create a funciton object or "costructor"
function Cat(name){ this.name = name}

// this creates by default a prototype.
Cat.prototype; // prints out Cat{}

// let create an new instance
var tom = new Cat("tom")

// if we set a field or method into the Cat.prototype that will be available to tom and other derived objects
Cat.prototype.age= 10

// now tom contains Cat {name: "tom", age: 10}
````

Douglas Crockford makes some analogies between a standard concept of class with its static/private/public methods and Javascript objects.
In Javascript there are no scope modifiers: "private"/"public"/"protected".
JavaScript functions are first-class objects, that means you can treat them just like any object.
````
// We define a "constructor" function with a private variable and a privileged method
// privileged method are similar to what other languages call "public". They have access to private members
function MyClass() {
  var priv = 1; 
  this.myPrivilegedMethod= function(){console.log("myMethod")}
}

// public methods in JS are added outside the object itself through the prototype
// Properties:
// - "this" keyword refers to MyClass
// - cannot access to MyClass private members. It can access only other "privileged" or "public" members
// - every instance of MyClass (created and future ones) will get this public method.
MyClass.prototype.myPublicMethod = function() {console.log("public metdhod"); }

// static method. are defined as follow and they do not have any relation with the instances we create of our class
MyClass.myStaticMethod = function() { ... }
